# TodoList

## Background:
During my initial role as a software developer in the Apollo team, I underwent a comprehensive training program aimed at enhancing my independent learning skills and gaining in-depth knowledge of the team's technologies.

## Description:
TodoList is a simple task management system. The project consists of a server-side application developed in Java Spark, which stores information in JSON files. On the client-side, TodoList utilizes React with Material-UI (MUI) as the design library, and Redux for managing the store.

- **Server Folder**: Contains all the server files built following the three-tier architecture.
- **my-app Folder**: Houses all the client files developed in React.
